## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing the development team at safehavendevs@turing.ac.uk.
If you encounter any problems while doing this then please open an issue that says "I have a security vulnerability to report" and we can convert this into a security advisory ticket.

In either case, we will open a security advisory for further discussion and will include you in any updates or discussion about how to fix the issue.
Once the issue is fixed we will make the security advisory public.
